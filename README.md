Welcome to my first project using TailwindCSS! ðŸŽ‰

About

Features
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using TailwindCSS's responsive utilities.
Modern UI: Clean and modern user interface with a focus on usability.
Utility-First Approach: Styling is done using utility classes, allowing for quick and flexible design adjustments.
